# github-actions-quickstart

Here is the note I submitted for feedback for the GitHub Actions Quickstart documentation: 

It was a helpful guide but there were two places where I thought the guide could be more clear. First, in the prerequisites section, there is a note regarding the "action tab". The documentation mentions that it should be a tab, but new users may not comprehend what constitutes as a tab and the description of the location is unclear. A screenshot of what it looks like when the actions tab exists would be very helpful, and a comparison to a screenshot when the actions tab doesn't exist could potentially be useful as well. Furthermore, there is a link in the note that leads to being able to manage the Github Actions settings for a repository. However, I think it would be more helpful to just include a description directly in this doc since the default is that actions generally are not configured. A screenshot that specifies that both checkboxes should be selected under the "allow [USER], and select non-[USER], actions and reusable workflows" option would be very helpful. I was not aware that the checkboxes needed to be selected after selecting the option which results in my changes not saving and confusion.
